      "Fit for the tun some magazine to store \n",
      "Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain, \n",

      "Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, \n",
      "Or undiminished brightness to be known, \n",
      "As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure; \n",
      "That glory then, when thou no more wast good, \n",
      "Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now \n",

      "Best with the best, the sender, not the sent, \n",
      "Or all at once; more glory will be won, \n",
      "Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold, \n",
      "Will save us trial what the least can do \n",
      "Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. \n",
      "The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; \n",
      "But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on, \n",
      "Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly \n",
      "He held it vain; awe from above had quelled \n",
      "His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh \n",
      "The western point, where those half-rounding guards \n",
      "Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, \n",
      "A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief, \n",
      "Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud. \n",
      "O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet \n",
      "Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern \n",
      "Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; \n",

      "Not likely to part hence without contest; \n",
      "Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. \n",
      "He scarce had ended, when those two approached, \n",
      "And brief related whom they brought, where found, \n",
      "How busied, in what form and posture couched. \n",
      "To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. \n",
      "Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed \n",

      "Of others, who approve not to transgress \n",
      "By thy example, but have power and right \n",

      "Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! \n",
      "To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. \n",
      "Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise, \n",
      "And such I held thee; but this question asked \n",
      "Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain! \n",
      "Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, \n",
      "Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt \n",
      "And boldly venture to whatever place \n",
      "Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change \n",
      "Torment with ease, and soonest recompense \n",
      "Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; \n",
      "To thee no reason, who knowest only good, \n",

      "The rest is true, they found me where they say; \n",
      "But that implies not violence or harm. \n",
      "Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved, \n",
      "Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied. \n",
      "O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise \n",
      "Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew, \n",
      "And now returns him from his prison 'scaped, \n",
      "Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise \n",
      "Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither \n",
      "Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed; \n",
      "So wise he judges it to fly from pain \n",
      "However, and to 'scape his punishment! \n",

      "The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged \n",
      "To thy deserted host this cause of flight, \n",
      "Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. \n",
      "To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern. \n",
      "Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, \n",
      "Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood \n",
      "Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid \n",
      "The blasting vollied thunder made all speed, \n",
      "And seconded thy else not dreaded spear. \n",

      "Argue thy inexperience what behoves \n",
      "From hard assays and ill successes past \n",
      "A faithful leader, not to hazard all \n",
      "Through ways of danger by himself untried: \n",
      "I, therefore, I alone first undertook \n",
      "To wing the desolate abyss, and spy \n",
      "This new created world, whereof in Hell \n",
      "Fame is not silent, here in hope to find \n",
      "Better abode, and my afflicted Powers \n",
      "To settle here on earth, or in mid air; \n",

      "Whose easier business were to serve their Lord \n",
      "High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne, \n",
      "And practised distances to cringe, not fight, \n",

      "To say and straight unsay, pretending first \n",
      "Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy, \n",
      "Argues no leader but a liear traced, \n",

      "Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? \n",
      "Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head. \n",
      "Was this your discipline and faith engaged, \n",
      "Your military obedience, to dissolve \n",

      "Within these hallowed limits thou appear, \n",

      "Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied. \n",
      "Then when I am thy captive talk of chains, \n",
      "Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then \n",
      "Far heavier load thyself expect to feel \n",

      "Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, \n",
      "Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels \n",
      "In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved. \n",
      "While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright \n",
      "Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns \n",
      "Their phalanx, and began to hem him round \n",
      "With ported spears, as thick as when a field \n",
      "Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends \n",
      "Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind \n",
      "Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands, \n",
      "Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves \n",
      "Prove chaff.  On the other side, Satan, alarmed, \n",
      "Collecting all his might, dilated stood, \n",
      "Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved: \n",
      "His stature reached the sky, and on his crest \n",
      "Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp \n",
      "What seemed both spear and shield:  Now dreadful deeds \n",
      "Might have ensued, nor only Paradise \n",
      "In this commotion, but the starry cope \n",
      "Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements \n",
      "At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn \n",
      "With violence of this conflict, had not soon \n",
      "The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray, \n",

      "In counterpoise, now ponders all events, \n",
      "Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights, \n",
      "The sequel each of parting and of fight: \n",
      "The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam, \n",
      "Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. \n",
      "Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; \n",
      "Neither our own, but given:  What folly then \n",
      "To boast what arms can do? since thine no more \n",
      "Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now \n",
      "To trample thee as mire:  For proof look up, \n",
      "And read thy lot in yon celestial sign; \n",
      "Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak, \n",
      "If thou resist.  The Fiend looked up, and knew \n",
      "His mounted scale aloft:  Nor more;but fled \n",
      "Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. \n",

      "Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power, \n",

      "So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose \n",
      "From the right hand of Glory where he sat; \n",
      "And the third sacred morn began to shine, \n",
      "Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound \n",
      "The chariot of Paternal Deity, \n",
      "Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, \n",
      "Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed \n",
      "By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each \n",

      "Of beryl, and careering fires between; \n",
      "Over their heads a crystal firmament, \n",
      "Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure \n",
      "Amber, and colours of the showery arch. \n",
      "He, in celestial panoply all armed \n",
      "Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, \n",
      "Ascended; at his right hand Victory \n",
      "Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow \n",
      "And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; \n",
      "And from about him fierce effusion rolled \n",
      "Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire: \n",
      "Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, \n",
      "He onward came; far off his coming shone; \n",
      "And twenty thousand (I their number heard) \n",
      "Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; \n",
      "He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime \n",
      "On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, \n",
      "Illustrious far and wide; but by his own \n",
      "First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised, \n",

      "Before him Power Divine his way prepared; \n",

      "Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went \n",
      "Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, \n",
      "And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled. \n",
      "This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, \n",
      "And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, \n",
      "Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. \n",
      "In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? \n",
      "But to convince the proud what signs avail, \n",
      "Or wonders move the obdurate to relent? \n",
      "They, hardened more by what might most reclaim, \n",
      "Grieving to see his glory, at the sight \n",
      "Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth, \n",
      "Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud \n",
      "Weening to prosper, and at length prevail \n",
      "Against God and Messiah, or to fall \n",
      "In universal ruin last; and now \n",
      "To final battle drew, disdaining flight, \n",
      "Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God \n",
      "To all his host on either hand thus spake. \n",
      "Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, \n",
      "Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest: \n",
      "Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God \n",
      "Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause; \n",
      "And as ye have received, so have ye done, \n",
      "Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew \n",
      "The punishment to other hand belongs; \n",
      "Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints: \n",
      "Number to this day's work is not ordained, \n",
      "Nor multitude; stand only, and behold \n",
      "God's indignation on these godless poured \n",
      "By me; not you, but me, they have despised, \n",
      "Yet envied; against me is all their rage, \n",
      "Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme \n",
      "Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains, \n",
      "Hath honoured me, according to his will. \n",
      "Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned; \n",
      "That they may have their wish, to try with me \n",
      "In battle which the stronger proves; they all, \n",
      "Or I alone against them; since by strength \n",
      "They measure all, of other excellence \n",
      "Not emulous, nor care who them excels; \n",
      "Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe. \n",
      "So spake the Son, and into terrour changed \n",
      "His countenance too severe to be beheld, \n",
      "And full of wrath bent on his enemies. \n",
      "At once the Four spread out their starry wings \n",
      "With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs \n",
      "Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound \n",
      "Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. \n",
      "He on his impious foes right onward drove, \n",
      "Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels \n",
      "The stedfast empyrean shook throughout, \n",

      "Stood on my feet: about me round I saw \n",
      "Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains, \n",
      "And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these, \n",
      "Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew; \n",

      "Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake; \n",
      "My tongue obeyed, and readily could name \n",
      "Whate'er I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light, \n",
      "And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay, \n",
      "Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains, \n",
      "And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, \n",

      "Not of myself;--by some great Maker then, \n",
      "In goodness and in power pre-eminent: \n",

      "And feel that I am happier than I know.-- \n",
      "While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither, \n",
      "From where I first drew air, and first beheld \n",
      "This happy light; when, answer none returned, \n",
      "On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers, \n",
      "Pensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep \n",
      "First found me, and with soft oppression seised \n",
      "My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought \n",
      "I then was passing to my former state \n",
      "Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: \n",
      "When suddenly stood at my head a dream, \n",
      "Whose inward apparition gently moved \n",
      "My fancy to believe I yet had being, \n",
      "And lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine, \n",

      "Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up \n",
      "A woody mountain; whose high top was plain, \n",
      "A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees \n",
      "Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw \n",
      "Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree, \n",
      "Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye \n",
      "Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite \n",
      "To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found \n",
      "Before mine eyes all real, as the dream \n",
      "Had lively shadowed:  Here had new begun \n",
      "My wandering, had not he, who was my guide \n",
      "Up hither, from among the trees appeared, \n",
      "Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe, \n",
      "In adoration at his feet I fell \n",
      "Submiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,' \n",
      "Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest \n",

      "Opening the way, but of divine effect \n",

      "He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon \n",

      "Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound \n",
      "Of instruments, that made melodious chime, \n",
      "Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved \n",
      "Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch, \n",
      "Instinct through all proportions, low and high, \n",
      "Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. \n",
      "In other part stood one who, at the forge \n",
      "Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass \n",
      "Had melted, (whether found where casual fire \n",

      "In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung \n",
      "Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on: \n",
      "The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes \n",
      "Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net \n",
      "Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose; \n",
      "And now of love they treat, till the evening-star, \n",
      "Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat \n",
      "They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke \n",
      "Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked: \n",
      "With feast and musick all the tents resound. \n",
      "Such happy interview, and fair event \n",
